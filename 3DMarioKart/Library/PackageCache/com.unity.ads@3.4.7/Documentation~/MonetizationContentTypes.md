# Monetization content types
## Overview
Unityâ€™s [Personalized Placements](MonetizationPersonalizedPlacements.md) optimize revenue by intelligently serving a mix of engaging content to the right player at the right time. Get to know the various content types, and learn how to deploy them in your monetization strategy.   

## Display ads
[Display ads](MonetizationBasicIntegration.md) are the basic full-screen interstitials that persist until the player dismisses them. These are most effectively implemented strategically at natural pauses or breaks in gameplay, such as a load or level change.
