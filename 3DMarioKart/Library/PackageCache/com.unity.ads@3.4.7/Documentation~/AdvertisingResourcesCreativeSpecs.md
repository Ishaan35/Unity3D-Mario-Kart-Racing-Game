# Creative asset specs
For more information on creative assets, see documentation on [creative Packs](AdvertisingCampaignsConfiguration.md#creative-packs) in the configuring campaigns guide. 

Please review Unity's [advertising content policy](https://unity3d.com/legal/advertising-content-policy). 

**Important**: Due to the sensitive nature of gambling ads across many of our publishers, Unity requires gambling advertisers to be managed accounts. Gambling creatives from unmanaged partners will be rejected in moderation. To become a managed partner or learn more about Unity's gambling ad policies, please [contact us](mailto:adops-support@unity3d.com). 

## Videos
Video ad assets marketing your app. While only one video is required, uploading a video for each orientation yields better optimization. When a creative contains both, Unityâ€™s valuation algorithm selects the best orientation to display.

* 30 seconds or less.
* H.264-encoded MP4 format.
* 16:9 pixel ratio for landscape videos, or 9:16 pixel ratio for portrait videos.
* Recommended file size is 10MB. Maximum file size is 100MB. Videos are re-encoded to be suitable for various bitrates. The final video shown will be optimized for the user's available network speed and cache settings.
* (Apple only) Due to Apple requirements, Unity recommends only depicting the Apple app store logo. See [Apple marketing guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#badges) for more information.

## End cards
End cards are creative assets displayed at the end of an ad with a call to action for users to download the advertised product. 
 
* Use JPG, PNG, or GIF format.
* Use one of the following dimension formats: 
  * For square end cards, use 800 x 800 (1:1) pixel resolution.
  * Otherwise, use 800 x 600 (4:3) pixel resolution for landscape images and 600 x 800 (3:4) pixel resolution for portrait images.
* (Apple only) Due to Apple requirements, Unity recommends only depicting the Apple app store logo on end cards for iOS videos. See [Apple marketing guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#badges) for more information.

**Note**: Dynamic cropping may occur when using landscape and portrait images, to account for different device sizes. To avoid losing critical information, allow a 100-pixel buffer from the top and bottom edges of portrait images, or left and right edges for landscape images.

## Playable ads 
Playable ads allow users to play a quick interactive demo of the game. 

### Requirements
Playable ads have the following required specifications:

* Use a single *HTML.index* file.
* The *index.html* file must be inlined, with no links to other files or folders.
* The file must be minified (optimized for machine-reading by removing empty spaces). 
* The file must be under 5MB.
* The ad must comply with Mobile Rich Media Ad Interface Definitions (MRAID) [2.0 guidelines](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/mobile-rich-media-ad-interface-definitions-mraid/). 

In addition, Unity requires the following specifications outside of MRAID:

* Android games must use Android version 4.4 or higher.
* iOS games must use iOS version 8.0 or higher.
* Ads should support both portrait and landscape orientations. 
* Ads should not need any network requests (XHR).
* Ads should link directly to the app store using [`mraid.open`](#linking-to-app-store-pages). 
* Wait for the MRAID `viewableChange` event before starting the playable content.

#### Additional notes
* The Unity Ads SDK controls the skippability of the ad.
* Any start/view/click attribution is handled server-side.
* A Unity Ads loading screen overlay will appear when the ad starts, and display for a minimum of 2 seconds. This allows for SDK initialization and prepares the player for the playable ad.

### MRAID methods
MRAID is the common API for mobile rich media ads running in mobile apps. MRAID is injected by the Unity Ads webview, so you can use MRAID methods detailed in the guidelines.

* View the complete [MRAID 2.0 guidelines](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/mobile-rich-media-ad-interface-definitions-mraid/) for detailed information on MRAID methods.
* Learn more about [MRAID best practices](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/mobile-rich-media-ad-interface-definitions-mraid/) and standards. 

The following methods are particularly useful for working with playable ads.

#### Linking to app store pages
Use the `mraid.open` method to link to the game's app store page.

`case "Android":mraid.open("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yourgame"); break;` 

`case "iOS":mraid.open("https://itunes.apple.com/us/yourgame?mt=8");`

#### Bootstrapping
Use this method to wait for the SDK to become ready:

```
// Wait for the SDK to become ready: 
if (mraid.getState() === 'loading') {
	// If the SDK is still loading, add a listener for the 'ready' event:
    mraid.addEventListener('ready', onSdkReady); 
} else {
	// Otherwise, if the SDK is ready, execute your function:
    onSdkReady(); 
}

// Implement a function that shows the ad when it first renders:
function onSdkReady() {
    // The viewableChange event fires if the ad container's viewability status changes.
    // Add a listener for the viewabilityChange event, to handle pausing and resuming: 
    mraid.addEventListener('viewableChange', viewableChangeHandler);
    // The isViewable method returns whether the ad container is viewable on the screen.
    if (mraid.isViewable()) {
        // If the ad container is visible, play the ad:
        showMyAd(); 
    }
}

// Implement a function for executing the ad:
function showMyAd() {
    // Insert code for showing your playable ad. 
}

// Implement a function that handles pausing and resuming the ad based on visibility:
function viewableChangeHandler(viewable) {
    if(viewable) {
    	// If the ad is viewable, show the ad:
        showMyAd(); 
    } else {
        // If not, pause the ad.
    }
}
```

### Testing playable ad implementation
Unity provides an app for testing and debugging playables in a real ad unit, instead of a desktop browser or simulator.
					
To get started, download the test app for the appropriate platform, then follow the provided instructions.

* [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ad-testing/id1463016906)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.auicreativetestapp)
